// Sprint 1
15/02 - made the car motor to work using my own sketch. Speed 
currently non adjustable.
16/02 - checked steering system, encountered problem (see problem log)
Problem fixed on the same day, steering system almost complete,
but still requires some adjustments.
17/02 - tested the motor, calibrated it.
25-26/02 - recalibrated the motor, tested the car driving 
(and steering) using powerbank as power source.
27/02 - demo successful
// Sprint 2
01/03 - tested ultrasonic sensor
02/03 - started testing IR sensors
06/03 - Discarded IR sensors due to their very limited
functionality, mounted ultrasonic sensor on turret,
 rotated by servo
08/03 - Programmed the turret
09/03-10/03 - Final adjustments to the turret, 
also tested optional sensor ultrasonic sensor 
mount on the back side of the car. Task finished
// Sprint 3
23/03 - started working on concept of radar for mapping
24/03-26/03 - working on radar concept
// Sprint 4
27/04-28/03 - working on radar concept
29/03-31/03 - researching ways to determine car's position for mapping
03/04-04/04 - working on 3d model of the car
05/04-07/04 - helping to prepare the car for the demo (modifying, testing it)
//Sprint 5
10/04-12/04 - finishing 3D model
13/04-14/04 - working on reconnect function for the controller app
18/04-finishing reconnection function, starting collision control system modification (3 ultrasonics on the front, one sharp IR sensor on the back)
19/04-21/04 - modifying collision control
//Sprint 6
24/04 - modifying collision control, replacing back sharp sensor with 4th ultrasonic(4 hours)
Modifying the main sketch so that it will support additional ultrasonic sensors,
testing updated system.
25/04 - Project planning meeting. Testing battery level measurement on separate Arduino (3 hours).
26/04 - Code review planning meeting, additional testing of updated collision control system. Doing research on battery level feature including usage of virtual circuit simulators. (6 hours).
27/04 - Updating 3D model, additional research on battery level, fixing battery's connection to motor (as it was damaged), continuing collision control testing. (3 hours).
28/04 - Replacing IR (sharp) sensor on car's back with ultrasonic, testing the updated system. Testing battery level measurement system on separate arduino. (3 hours).
02/05 - Updating 3D model. (2 hours).
03/05 - Further work with battery level and collision control (2,5 hours).
04/05 - Working with battery level feature (3 hours).
05/05 - Working with battery level. 
EUREKA!!! Finally built functional voltage divider using 47 and 100 K Ohm resistors to prevent Arduino from frying during voltage measurement of 10.5 V battery. It's pretty accurate, and gives values almost identical to multimeter's. GUI and app part still
need to be implemented (3.5 hours) 
08/05 - Working with battery - making smaller voltage divider for placement on the car, doing additional research on charge/voltage relationship (3 hours)
09/05 - Soldering additional wires to battery socket, connecting voltage divider to Arduino Mega, addtional testing of new feature (2.5 hours).
10/05 - Battery level feature finished and integrated, can send values to phone now. Attempted to test collision control, noticed strange behavior of the motor (abnormal moves and sounds). Suspected reasons were: insufficient voltage, connection problems and I suspected transmission damage. I decided to disassemble it, and found that one of the three gears in it is damaged. Started working on solution together with team members.
11/05 - Final minor adjustments to battery, attempts to find replacement gear (3 hours).
12/05 -
