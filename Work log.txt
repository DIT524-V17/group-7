15/02 - made the car motor to work using my own sketch. Speed 
currently non adjustable.
16/02 - checked steering system, encountered problem (see problem log)
Problem fixed on the same day, steering system almost complete,
but still requires some adjustments.
17/02 - tested the motor, calibrated it.
