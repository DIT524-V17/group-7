// Sprint 1
15/02 - made the car motor to work using my own sketch. Speed 
currently non adjustable.
16/02 - checked steering system, encountered problem (servo had broken gear in it)
Problem fixed on the same day (replaced defunct servo with new one), steering system almost complete,
but still requires some adjustments.
17/02 - tested the motor, calibrated it.
25-26/02 - recalibrated the motor, tested the car driving 
(and steering) using powerbank as power source.
27/02 - demo successful
// Sprint 2
01/03 - tested ultrasonic sensor
02/03 - started testing IR sensors
06/03 - Discarded IR sensors due to their very limited
functionality, mounted ultrasonic sensor on turret,
 rotated by servo
08/03 - Programmed the turret
09/03-10/03 - Final adjustments to the turret, 
also tested optional sensor ultrasonic sensor 
mount on the back side of the car. Task finished
// Sprint 3
23/03 - started working on concept of radar for mapping
24/03-26/03 - working on radar concept
// Sprint 4
27/04-28/03 - working on radar concept
29/03-31/03 - researching ways to determine car's position for mapping
03/04-04/04 - working on 3d model of the car
05/04-07/04 - helping to prepare the car for the demo (modifying, testing it)
//Sprint 5
10/04-12/04 - finishing 3D model
13/04-14/04 - working on reconnect function for the controller app
18/04-finishing reconnection function, starting collision control system modification (3 ultrasonics on the front, one sharp IR sensor on the back)
19/04-21/04 - modifying collision control
//Sprint 6
24/04 - modifying collision control, replacing back sharp sensor with 4th ultrasonic(4 hours)
Modifying the main sketch so that it will support additional ultrasonic sensors,
testing updated system.
25/04 - Project planning meeting. Testing battery level measurement on separate Arduino (3 hours).
26/04 - Code review planning meeting, additional testing of updated collision control system. Doing research on battery level feature including usage of virtual circuit simulators. (6 hours).
27/04 - Updating 3D model, additional research on battery level, fixing battery's connection to motor (as it was damaged), continuing collision control testing. (3 hours).
28/04 - Replacing IR (sharp) sensor on car's back with ultrasonic, testing the updated system. Testing battery level measurement system on separate arduino. (3 hours).
02/05 - Updating 3D model. (2 hours).
03/05 - Further work with battery level and collision control (2,5 hours).
04/05 - Working with battery level feature (3 hours).
05/05 - Working with battery level. 
EUREKA!!! Finally built functional voltage divider using 47 and 100 K Ohm resistors to prevent Arduino from frying during voltage measurement of 10.5 V battery. It's pretty accurate, and gives values almost identical to multimeter's. GUI and app part still
need to be implemented (3.5 hours) 
//Sprint 7
08/05 - Working with battery - making smaller voltage divider for placement on the car, doing additional research on charge/voltage relationship (3 hours)
09/05 - Soldering additional wires to battery socket, connecting voltage divider to Arduino Mega, addtional testing of new feature (2.5 hours).
10/05 - Battery level feature finished and integrated, can send values to phone now. Attempted to test collision control, noticed strange behavior of the motor (abnormal moves and sounds). Suspected reasons were: insufficient voltage, connection problems and I suspected transmission damage. I decided to disassemble it, and found that one of the three gears in it is damaged. Started working on solution together with team members.
11/05 - Final minor adjustments to battery, attempts to find replacement gear (3 hours).
12/05 - Fully charged the batteries, noticed unexpectedly high voltage at max charge. Did more research and experiments on NIMH charge/voltage relationship, changed values for display a little bit, tested updated system (2 hours).
15/05 - As I could not buy the replacement gear, I decided to 3D print it. Was making gear 3D model in Sketchup (4,5 hours).
16/05 - Unsuccessfully tried to fix the car's transmission with 3D printed gear, but it had hole of wrong size because of 3D printer's inaccuracy. Possibly many versions of gear must be printed and tested in order to make working version. Made new improved gear model right away, waiting for it to be printed. (2 hours).
17/05 - Gear turned out to be too big. Making new improved gear models, experimenting with buzzer (3 hours).
18/05 - Making more improved gear models (3 hours).
19/05 - New versions did not work as well. Making further improved gear versions' models, further modifying collision control system (made plastic mount for it) (3 hours).
//Sprint 8
22/05 - Working with final project report (5 hours).
23/05 - Finally newest version of gear makes driving the car possible, although making scratching sound at the same time. Working with collision control system, making 3D models of new gears with thinner teeth for more smooth motor motion (5 hours).
24/05 - Additional testing of collision control system (3 hours).
28/05 - Final adjustments and car testing before the demo, another gear replacement (6 hours).
